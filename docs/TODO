* DFS iterator and a common interface for iterators as a Node method
* the other iterators: BFS and iterative deepening
* the hyper part
* rendering engine for hypergraphs

* self-modifieble graph
* graph which keeps its own history
* testing
* race detection
* further iterators (perhaps the "hyper" one, which would allow combining with a regular iterator like DFS)
* documentation
* benchmark and refactor problem areas (most probably iterators)
